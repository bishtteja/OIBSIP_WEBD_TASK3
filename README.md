# 🌸 Pookie Temperature Converter 🌸

## 🌼 Why I Made This

I wanted to take a simple temperature converter and give it a **soft, pastel, pookie aesthetic** 💖. Instead of just numbers and plain colors, I made it cozy, cute, and fun to use!

## 🪄 What I Did

* Built the converter with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**
* Added a **pastel animated gradient background** that changes smoothly
* Designed a **floating container card** with soft shadows
* Styled input fields, dropdowns, and buttons to look more playful
* Added **cute emojis & messages** in the results ✨

## 🛠️ Tools I Used

* **HTML5** → for structure
* **CSS3** → for pastel gradient, floating animations & soft UI
* **JavaScript** → to actually convert °C ↔ °F
* **Kawaii vibes** 🐻💕

## 🎉 What Came Out of It

* A temperature converter that feels **warm and adorable** 🌸
* Cute little floating effect on the card ✨
* Playful output messages like:

  * ⚠️ *Oopsie! Please enter a valid number 🐻💕*
  * 💖 *25 °C = 77.00 °F 💖*
* Something that feels less like a boring tool and more like a little **pookie web toy** 💕
