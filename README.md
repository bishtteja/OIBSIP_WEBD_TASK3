# Pookie Temperature Converter

## Objective

This project is a simple temperature converter that turns Celsius into Fahrenheit and vice versa. Instead of making it plain, I designed it with a soft, pastel theme to give it a more welcoming and cozy feel.

## What I Did

* Built the converter with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**
* Added a pastel animated background for a friendly look
* Styled the input box, dropdown, and button with a soft design
* Added smooth floating animations for the container
* Displayed the conversion results in a clear and readable format

## Tools Used

* **HTML5** – for structure
* **CSS3** – for styling and animations
* **JavaScript** – for the conversion logic

## Outcome

* A working temperature converter with a clean, pastel theme
* Simple, user-friendly interface
* Clear results for both Celsius and Fahrenheit conversions
* A project that feels light and pleasant to use
